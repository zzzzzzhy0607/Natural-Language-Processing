# Project #1

This is your repository for which you have full rights. You can also replace this readme.

You have two deliverables:
1. A notebook (Jupyter or R)
2. A scored answer file for INPUT.txt which is tab-delimited and producing text like this (id and predicted label):

801989080477154944  positive

Your notebook should be fully runnable when cloned to another computer such that your code executes without error. This is an element in the rubric, so have someone on the team test this.
